# Non-Fungigle Tokens (NFTs)

## Few key points:

- NFTs can be anything that can be digitally produced, like a picture, audio, video, tweet, or an in-game collectible etc.
- Any blockchain can be used for minting the NFTs we can even use our [Finscale Wallet](https://wallet.finscale.net/).
- We can add royalties for every piece of artwork sold, and gain funds by resale also.
NFTs can be used for spreading a social message also, like Dintoons cartoons, Anju's sketches, Eden’s art, and Mohak’s social activist portraits.

The NFT market works differently. Its artists, usually immersed in the world of blockchains and cryptocurrency, use social media to build their audience in that community, and then sell their work directly to crypto collectors through specialist online platforms like MakersPlace and Nifty Gateway. These platforms take a roughly 10% commission on each sale and offer artists automated resale royalties at rates set by the artists themselves. According to a British crypto artist who goes by the name Robert Alice, “sometimes, after three or four weeks, you are making more money from the resale than you are from the initial value of the drop.”

A sample NFT attributes to code:
```
{
 "name": "FUNK ART",   
 "description": "This piece Funk Town of art was made over 3 months for different businesses. The business is called Circle Eats Poetry and their philosophy is to mix art, poetry and food into an experience and a product. They do it by making cookies, that they pack in boxes made from art (like Funk Town). And for the poetry aspect, they put poems in the boxes. So Funk Town was cut up and made into boxes for the cookies to be sold in.",   
 "image": "URI",   
 "attributes": [
	“royalty”: 15  // 15% royalty to the artist on every resale 
]
}
```
## C-Chain Contract

We can have a contract over ETH and Bridge that to Avalanche, there the artist adds up his wallet and when art is sold the amount will be distributed.
